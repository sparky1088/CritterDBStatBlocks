# CritterDBStatBlocks

The first of these are based on MaD by Stone Strix with some names changed as a C&D was sent. 

Changes are as follows:
Myr - Namla (Arabic for ant)
Sliver - Drzazga (Polish for sliver)
Lionin- Liontári (Greek for lion)
Spellskite - Spellculling (based on word cull meaning gather best parts of)
Eldrazi Scion - Eisokx Scion
Brood - Prole (latin for brood also english means working class member)
Sire of Stagnation - Origin of Torpidity (literally synonyms of the words)
Ulamog, the Ceasless Hunger- Zredreg the Everlasting Hunger
Frost Giant Jarl - Frost Giant Jötnar
Caustic Crawler - Mordant Stalker
Chamaelean - Chamaeleon (after the constellation)
Phelddagrif - winged hippo? this one was more of an im tired and have no clue how to rename...
Other Notes:
Foxhawk - I changed the talons to slashing damage as I felt piercing was incorrect (I could be wrong I haven't double checked)
Sylvan Stalker - left due to me not being able to find a mtg card with the same name. Sylvan simply means wooded so I thought it was fine.

I should probably rename Orc Hand of Gruumsh but i ran out of ideas.
Vodyanoy - left alone as its a Monster in slavic mythology
Some Alignments are in the description as any nuetral etc could not be used in the critterDB system.
edit: formatting it was gross so i added some spaces...
